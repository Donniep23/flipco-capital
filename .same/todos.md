### **✅ Integration Complete & Working:**

- ✅ Opportunities convert to project format correctly
- ✅ Projects appear in "Upcoming" tab
- ✅ Filter buttons show correct counts
- ✅ All project details display properly
- ✅ **Testing guide created** at `.same/testing-guide.md`

### **🐛 Bug Fix Applied (Version 188):**
**Problem:** Default investment opportunities (Maple Ridge Drive, Oakmont Circle) weren't appearing in Projects page Upcoming tab.

**Root Cause:** Homepage was only storing defaults in React state, not in localStorage.

**Solution:** Modified homepage to save default opportunities to localStorage on first load.

**Result:** Projects page can now load and display default opportunities. Upcoming tab now shows 5 projects instead of 3.

### **🎯 Integration Flow:**
```
Admin Panel → Add Investment Opportunity
         ↓
Saves to localStorage (flipco_investment_opportunities)
         ↓
         ├──→ Homepage loads and displays
         └──→ Projects page loads and displays in "Upcoming" tab
```
