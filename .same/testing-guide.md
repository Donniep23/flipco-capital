  - Timeline
  - Investment tier ROIs (Bronze, Silver, Gold)

  - Each displays as a project card with before/after images
  - Shows ROI, timeline, highlights

- Deletions remove from both pages
- No duplicate entries

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions:

### Issue: "Upcoming projects don't show"
**Solution:** Make sure you're clicking the "Upcoming" tab, not just viewing "All Projects"

### Issue: "Changes don't appear"
**Solution:** Refresh the page (Cmd/Ctrl + R) to reload from localStorage

### Issue: "Count is wrong"
**Solution:** Check browser console for errors, clear localStorage and reload

### Issue: "Property appears twice"
**Solution:** Check that property IDs are unique in admin panel

---

## 📊 How the Sync Works:

```
Admin Panel (Investment Opportunities Editor)
         ↓
   Click "Save Changes"
         ↓
localStorage.setItem("flipco_investment_opportunities", JSON.stringify(opportunities))
         ↓
         ├──→ Homepage useEffect → loads from localStorage → displays in "Current Investment Opportunities"
         └──→ Projects Page useEffect → loads from localStorage → converts to project format → displays in "Upcoming" tab
```

---

## 💾 Data Storage:

**Key:** `flipco_investment_opportunities`

**Format:**
```json
[
  {
    "id": "maple-ridge",
    "name": "Maple Ridge Drive",

## 🚀 Next Steps After Testing:

Once you verify everything works:

3. **Monitor:** Check that investors can view opportunities
4. **Iterate:** Add more properties as deals come in
