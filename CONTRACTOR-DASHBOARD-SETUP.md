# 🔨 Contractor Dashboard - Individual Data Setup

## ✅ **FIXED: Each Contractor Now Sees Their Own Data!**

I've updated the contractor dashboard system so each contractor sees only their own projects, earnings, and tasks.

---

## 🎯 **How It Works Now:**

### **Before (OLD):**
- ❌ All contractors saw the same demo data
- ❌ No way to customize per contractor
- ❌ Same projects for everyone

### **After (NEW):**
- ✅ Each contractor has their own unique data
- ✅ Projects assigned individually
- ✅ Separate earnings, ratings, and stats
- ✅ Live updates per contractor

---

## 🔐 **Contractor Logins & Their Data:**

| Username | Password | Projects | Earnings | Status |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|--------|
| **demo** | demo123 | 2 projects | $85,750 | Active |
| **ahmed_hassan** | MySecurePass123! | 2 projects | $124,300 | Active |
| **john_martinez** | MyPassword456! | 1 project | $67,200 | Active |
| **maria_rodriguez** | MyPass789! | 2 projects | $98,500 | Active |

All contractor data is stored in **localStorage** under the key:

```

Structure:
