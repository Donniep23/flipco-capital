# üì∑ Photo Upload Guide - Sparks St Renovation

Your Flipco Capital website now supports multiple before photos for projects! The Sparks St Renovation project is set up to display 3 actual before photos you provided, but they need to be properly uploaded to work on the live site.

## üñºÔ∏è Your Before Photos (Ready to Upload)

You provided these 3 excellent before photos that showcase the property's original condition:

1. **Living Room Photo** - Shows red chevron accent wall, old furniture, and tile flooring
2. **Kitchen Photo** - Shows dark wood cabinets, granite countertops, and original condition
3. **Office/Bedroom Photo** - Shows built-in storage, hardwood floors, and cluttered condition

## üöÄ How to Upload Your Photos

### Option 1: Manual Upload (Recommended)
1. **Save your photos** with these names:
   - `sparks-before-living-room.jpg`
   - `sparks-before-kitchen.jpg`
   - `sparks-before-office.jpg`

2. **Upload to project folder**:
   - Create a `public/projects/sparks/` folder
   - Upload your 3 before photos to this folder

3. **Update the code** in `src/app/projects/page.tsx`:
   ```javascript
   beforeImages: [
     "/projects/sparks/sparks-before-living-room.jpg",
     "/projects/sparks/sparks-before-kitchen.jpg",
     "/projects/sparks/sparks-before-office.jpg"
   ],
   ```

### Option 2: Cloud Storage (Professional)
1. **Upload to image hosting** (like Cloudinary, AWS S3, or similar)
2. **Get the public URLs** for each photo
3. **Update the beforeImages array** with the real URLs

## üîß Technical Details

The gallery system automatically detects projects with multiple before images:
- If `beforeImages` array exists with 2+ photos ‚Üí Shows gallery view
- If single `beforeImage` only ‚Üí Shows standard single photo
- Gallery is clickable and opens modal with all photos
- Modal includes project name and photo descriptions

## üì± User Experience

When investors view the Sparks St Renovation project:
1. They see the main before photo with "BEFORE (3 photos)" label
2. Gallery icon indicates more photos available
3. Clicking opens modal with all 3 before photos
4. Each photo has descriptive text explaining the area
5. "Close" button returns to project view

This creates **maximum transparency** - investors can see exactly what condition the property was in before renovation work began.

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Upload your actual photos** using Option 1 or 2 above
2. **Test the gallery** to ensure all photos load correctly
3. **Update descriptions** if needed to match your specific photos
4. **Deploy the site** to make it live for potential investors

Your before photos significantly enhance credibility and transparency - they show real property conditions rather than generic stock images!
