# 📋 Session Summary - Version 187

## What Was Accomplished

From the previous session continuation, we verified and documented the **Investment Opportunities Auto-Sync** feature that was already implemented.

---

## ✅ Verification Completed

### Investment Opportunities Integration:
The system already had working integration where:
1. Admin adds property in `/admin/edit/investment-opportunities`
2. Property saves to localStorage
3. Property automatically appears:
   - **Homepage** - "Current Investment Opportunities" section
   - **Projects Page** - "Upcoming" tab

### What We Verified:
- ✅ Data loads from localStorage correctly
- ✅ Opportunities convert to project format properly
- ✅ Projects appear in correct tab
- ✅ Filter counts are accurate
- ✅ Edit/delete operations sync across pages

```
Admin Panel (Investment Opportunities Editor)
         ↓
localStorage.setItem("flipco_investment_opportunities")

         ├──→ Homepage useEffect loads data
         │    └──→ Displays in "Current Investment Opportunities"
         │
         └──→ Projects Page useEffect loads data
              └──→ Converts to project format

```

### How to Manage:
